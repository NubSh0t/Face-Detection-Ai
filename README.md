# Face-Detection-Ai
Face detection ai using keras pre-trained model and torch.
Uses the model, and by classifying the data set (will require you to make another independent folder called dataset in the same directory) it trains the model to work best on the current data.
For more accuracy, the "dataset" folder can further be divided into subfolders to refine the model better and work with more accuracy.
